# Everything you need to know about SOS chaining in Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon

## Basics of SOS chaining

    Once finished the first Island Trial, wild Pokemon will then be able to call upon other pokemon during battle.
    Not all pokemon call allies, and not every pokemon calls it's species as an ally. When a pokemon calls an ally to battle it will be a two on one situation. 
    I like to call the Pokemon on the right the 'caller', the caller will only call one pokemon into battle, so if you want to chain this pokemon you need to use an adrenaline orb to allow the caller to call more pokemon.
    The fastest way to get the caller to call more pokemon is for it to have 1 HP, so false swipe pokemon are your friend here.
    Once the caller is at 1 HP, you used the adrenanline orb, all you need to do is faint the 'called' pokemon, one after another, thus starting the chain.
    Every Pokemon fainted is incremmenting the chain, but before we get to the benefits of chaining theres one important reminded.
    If a Pokemon is at 1 HP and runs out of moves, they will try to struggle and faint themselves, so you need to come up with a count in your head for when to switch the caller.
    Some Pokemon like chansey have light screen which is a 35 pp move so they can be in battle for awhile, but other Pokemon might max out at a total of 30-40 PP.
    To be safe every 10-20 pokemon you faint consider swapping the caller, to do this simple take the new called pokemon down to 1 HP, and fainting the orginal caller Pokemon.
    DO NOT, apply status condtions to a Pokemon as it can make them calling a Pokemon into battle either non exsistent or the rate is extremely reduced.
    Only status condition the Pokemon you wan to catch.
    So now that we are passed the intial setup lets go into detail.

## Rewards of SOS chaining

    The key number here is 30, a chain of 30 Pokemon fainted starts to provide insane benefits.
    While there are small increases in these benefits up to 30 I will not be covering them.

#### After a 30 chain

    1. 4 guaranteed perfect IVs.
    2. 15% Chance of a Pokemon to have their Hidden Ability.

#### After a 70 chain   

     - Chances of Pokemon being shiny without shiny charm is 1/1024.
     - With Shiny charm becomes 1/683 chance.

## Other benefits of SOS chaining

    If you want to EV train your Pokemon, this is hands down the fastest method ever in Pokemon.
    Buying items doesn't count because most games take awhile to acquire money which most people do not consider.

    Called Pokemon = Wingull - 2 Spd EV [ Caller = 1 Spd EV ]
    - Base: 2 Spd EV
    - With Power Anklet = 2 + ([Power Ankelt = 8] * 2) = 18
    - With Power Anklet & Pokerus = 18 * 2 = 36
    So to get 252 EVs in one stat each method above works as follows
    - 126 Pokemon fainted
    - 14 Pokemon fainted
    - 7 Pokemon fainted

    I would also like to mention every Pokemon in your party who gains EXP from a battle [EXP share] takes part in gaining EVs points.
    So if every pokemon in your party had the associated held item and Pokerus, it would take 7 fainted wingulls to increase 6 Pokemons Spd EV points to max.
    making it the offical fastest EV training method out there. Beside owning x999 of each EV increasing Item which in my mind doesn't count.
