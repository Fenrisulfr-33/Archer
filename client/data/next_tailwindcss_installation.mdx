## Getting Started with Next, TailwindCSS and MDX

1. Create your create your Next.js base.

  ```
    npx create-next-app my-project
    cd my-project
  ```

2. Install the tailwindCss package
    - The `init -p` is the file needed for settings up your custom class or overwriting current ones

  ```
  npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
  npx tailwindcss init -p
  ```
3. [Optional] If you are writing a blog site I highly recommened using this. 
    - Link: [TailwindCSS Typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin).

  ```
  npm install -D @tailwindcss/typography
  ```

4. In your newly created `tailwind.config.js` file add the `jit` (Just in time) engine. Make sure the
the `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, and `.tsx` files are being hit by tailwindcss. The screens is not neccessary
and you can remove them, I personally like my site to be very reactive to certain size screens.

  ```
  module.exports = {
    mode: 'jit',
    purge: ['./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}', './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
    darkMode: true, // or 'media' or 'class'
    theme: {
      screens: {
        phone: '480px',
        tablet: '768px',
        laptop: '1024px',
        desktop: '1200px',
        wide: '1280px',
        ultrawide: '1536px',
      },
      extend: {
      },
    },
    variants: {
      extend: {},
    },
    plugins: [
      require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
    ],
  }
  ```

5. Inside your globals.css add the following. 

  ```
  @tailwind base;
  @tailwind components;
  @tailwind utilities;
  ```

6. [Optional] If you want to add styles or classes to your entire webpade, you can do so like this.
The reason we add `@layer` is because these need to come before the utilites or else we wouldn't be able to 
add custom classes and tailwinds default classes. This allows you to sneak a couple of classes right in the the
className not including your custom class.
    - Link: [TailwindCSS @apply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrftauE2Vyk).

  ```
  @tailwind base;
  @tailwind components;
  @tailwind utilities;

  @layer components {
    .h1 {
      @apply <insert tailwindcss classes here for all h1 tags, etc...>
    }
  }
  ```

7. Have fun and play around!

  ```
  npm run dev
  ```
