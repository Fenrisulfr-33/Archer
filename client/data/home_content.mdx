## Overview

    The purpose of this site is to provide information for anyone intrested in any of the following
    tabs or sub tabs as shown in the Navigation bar. Most of the information is somewhat bias, meaning
    everything is put together by me and sorta for me. While I plan on implementing new features like user login
    and team builds with stats and pdf downloads, alot of this stuff takes time and money. If you like this
    page you can email me ideas for new tabs and information or just to add to the current pages at *Insert Email Here*.
    Otherwise you can also support me on my patreon, I haven't really thought of any bonus for the pateron page yet
    so I would also like you to email me your recommendation on what you would pay money for monthly to support me.

## Features currently in the works and reasoning

### Pokemon page moduals

    Having moduals for almsot all realtive infromation on a page.
    This is important to me because alot of information on Pokemon or TemTem has alot of redirection to another page for something that could just be a pop up.
    Once implemented I believe this feature along with team building will seperate my site from others.
    I do not want to take away from sites like [tem.team](https://tem.team/ "Current best site for Temtem"), [Serebii](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex/ "Great historic pokemon site"), [Smogon](https://www.smogon.com/dex/ss/pokemon/ "The site for Pokemon Comp Builds"), and [PokemonDB](https://pokemondb.net/ "Best site for pokemon information").
    
    The problem is that you need each site to get all the information.
    
    Where pokemonDB lacks is competitive builds and easy access to ability or move descriptions, you are redirected to an entire new page.
    Even if you want to check a pokemons different moves from another generation you are redirected and lose the basic info of the pokemon.
    
    Serebii has terrible Navigation, I do not care what you say I have been using the site for 5 years and they almost need a page that just explains where everything is.
    For a site that old they need to update their nav, I love them to death but cannot stay with the old times.

    tem.team is a great site overall, except they do not have any comp builds out at the time I am writing this.
    I get the Asbury update just came out and the meta changed, but you should be leaving old builds up, and they also should redirect you to a new page.
    Every build is small enough to glance at and then have a button like, `add to my team` or `save build for late` or `update build`.
    I do not want to take away from their site though there awesome.
    TemTem Wiki sucks though, same thing, the naviation is werid as in...
    They have a types dropdown page but not quick access to a type weakness chart unless you search for it, I mean as a current user I want to go on your site and just get the chart.
    
    I really shouldn't need the search bar for anything.
    You could also have a basic menu of buttons on any of these sites no matter the page that had moduals for type weakness, pokeballs, temtem location, etc...

    But nothing I say matters unless I build a better site.

### TemTem

    Temtem is currently working on producing an API that so creators can create up-to-date sites. 
    While thats awesome and I will use it to extract info, I will eventually build my own because I enjoy data modeling.
    To which when I complete I will post a link of video on this site showing how I did it and why I did it.

### Articles page

    Eventually I want to break this apart and have categories and use a CMS but for now this will have to do.
